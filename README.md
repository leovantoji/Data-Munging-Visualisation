# Kaggle Data Visualization: 
### [From Non-Coder to Coder Micro-Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization-from-non-coder-to-coder)
- **Trends** - A trend is defined as a pattern of change.
  - `sns.lineplot` - **Line charts** are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.
- **Relationship** - There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.
  - `sns.barplot` - **Bar charts** are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.
  - `sns.heatmap` - **Heatmaps** can be used to find colour-coded patterns in tables of numbers.
  - `sns.scatterplot` - **Scatter plots** show the relationship between 2 continuous variables; if colour-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.
  - `sns.regplot` - Including a **regression line** in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between 2 variables.
  - `sns.lmplot` - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple colour-coded groups.
  - `sns.swarmplot` - **Categorical scatter plot** show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. Data points are separated in the chart.
  - `sns.stripplot` - Similar to `sns.swarmplot`. Data points can overlap in the chart.
- **Distribution** - We visualise distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a varible, along with how likely they are.
  - `sns.distplot` - **Histograms** show the distribution of a single numerical variable.
  - `sns.kdeplot` - **KDE plots (Kernel Density Estimation)** (or **2D KDE plots**) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).
  - `sns.jointplot` - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.
